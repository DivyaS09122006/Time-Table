# Time-Table

**College Timetable Scheduler** — A Python project to generate and manage class timetables for courses, faculty, and student groups. Includes both an admin scheduler and a student timetable viewer. 📅

This project automates the creation and visualization of college timetables. It handles course scheduling, faculty availability, and student group constraints to produce conflict-free timetables. Students can also view their personalized schedule using the student viewer module.

## ✨ Features

### 🏫 Admin Scheduler

* Generates a timetable based on days, slots, rooms, faculties, and courses.
* Ensures no faculty or room is double-booked.
* Supports flexible slot durations (e.g., 30 mins, 1 hr, 1.5 hrs).
* Stores data in constraint matrices for easy manipulation and visualization.

### 👩‍🎓 Student Viewer

* Students can query their batch timetable easily.
* Provides clean tabular output using pandas.
* Can visualize daily and weekly schedules.

### 🎨 Unique Approach

* Scheduling is conceptualized like a **checkerboard layering problem**:
  Each `day × time slot × room` is a cell.
  Faculty, course, and student availability act as colored overlays.
* Conflicts are detected when overlays collide, ensuring conflict-free timetables.
* This analogy helped design intuitive constraint matrices for the scheduler.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.12+**
* **NumPy** → matrix-based timetable representation
* **Pandas** → student timetable viewer
* **Matplotlib** → optional, for visualizations
